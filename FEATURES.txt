Features:


Program Structure:
For the implementation of A2 we have a created 8 files:


        1. Main.java: 
                This is where the program is executed and where all of our calls
                are made. This file takes the inputs from the users and calls on
                    our other methods and classes.
        
        2. Admin.java: 
                This file is where the transit system's stats are collected and stored
                this includes the total revenue on any given day and the number of
                station/stops reached by all card holders on any given day.
        
        3. CardHolder.java:
                This is where our user/card holders information is stored, it keeps track
                of the card holder's name, email, and cards that are registered to the card
                holder along with a monthly cost.
        
        4. Card.java: 
                The Card file creates a card and keeps track of the card info, including balance,
                status, the current trip the card is on, and the current transit vehicle the card is on


        5. Trips.java:        
                        Stores one continuous trip of the user. Keeps track of when the person enters a  bus or a train
while checking if the time given is valid and the given location is valid, also    makes a nested ArrayList which keeps track of the entry and exit locations within the trip.


        6. Subway.java:
                         Represents a Subway which has a subway fare and an ArrayList of stations
                                          this subway stops at, The stations are in order of which they appear, so the first stop is at index
                          0 and the last stop is at the last index of the ArrayList. It checks when the card holder
                        taps in or taps out of a subway and calculates the cost and charges the card holder.


        7. Buses.java:
Represents a Bus which has a bus fare and the bus number with an ArrayList of 
the bus stops. It checks when the card holder taps in or taps out of a bus and calculates the cost and charges the card holder


        8. TransitSystem.java: 
                A transit class that is the parent class of Bus.java and Subway.java, it initializes
exit time and an ArrayList of stops .


        




Features:


1) $2 is deducted from the travel card's balance everytime a card holder enters a bus.


2) $0.50 is deducted from the travel card's balance for every subway station that is reached by the card holder, excluding the first one, when the card holder exits a bus.


3) Doesn't allow a card holder to illegally enter or exit a station or bus without tapping out or tapping in from the previous bus or station.


4) Keep track of all trips(entrance and exit locations) taken by a card holder.


5) Can create bus routes(stops for each route) and subway system(stations).


6) Can choose from presets of cities(containing bus routes and subway stations).


7) Keeps track of the times when the card taps in and out of a bus or subway station.


8) Caps each trip at $6, so any joint trips made within the 2 hour period will cost at most $6 after that any trips made will be free within that 2 hour period


9) An account can be made using and email and name of the the user


10) Cardholder can change its name but not its email address


11) Card holder can access their last 3 trips(these trips must be completed, ongoing trips will not be printed)


12) Cardholder can add or remove travel cards 


13) Cardholders can add balance of $10, $20 or $50 to their card balance each time


14) When a cardholder creates its card, the starting balance is $19


15) Cardholders view their 3 recent trips, suspend a stolen card as well as track their average transit cost each month 


16) Admin can print daily report, which includes the statistics for any given day (revenue and number of stops/stations reached by card holders).


17) Admin can get the total revenue of the transit system.




18) User can enter and exit a bus


19) User can enter and exit a subway


20) Print a specific error message for any invalid input




Bonus features and a description of them
* Ability to choose from a set of preset cities that include preset bus stops and a subway for each preset city
* As an Admin task we added the functionality to add bus routes and stations after starting the code. This allows the size of the city to be increased.
* Gives option to replace a suspended card with a new card immediately after the card is suspended


        


Description of code architecture


Modularity
* Subway cost - Kept this as a global variable so it is easier for the developer to change this to the cost that they want
* Bus Cost - This was also set as global variables as it becomes easier for the developer to change to the cost that they want
Inheritance 
* The TransitSystem class is an abstract class with different modes of public transportation as the subclasses(Subway and Buses are the subclasses in this case)
* More modes of transportation can be added as subclasses of TransitSystem
* Subway and Busses inherit some attributes from its parent class TransitSystem.java. It allows the bus and train to share attributes they have in common without repeated code
Static and Instance Methods
* In the Main.java we used static methods for most methods in the main as we did not instantiate main thus we needed to use static methods
* However in other files like Trips.java,Buses.java etc we used instance methods as we are changing the specific object attributes, this way we are able to update the objects based on the user inputs
Main(Flow Control)
* The main contains the console which runs our main program, and the main also takes care of taking input from the user using a Scanner object, after this it checks for valid formatting and valid input, then based on the input from the user calls the desired method. The main is also responsible for controlling the flow of the program
* Switch Cases, used switch cases to check different inputs from the user. This was used Main.java


Exceptions 
* To handle invalid code exceptions we used a try catch statement
* The try statement was used to run the block of code we wanted to test for any invalid code exceptions, and in the catch statement we check for any exceptions that might be raised and printed an error without disrupting the flow of our code


Bus and Subway
* TransitSystem is the parent class 
* Bus and Subway inherits from the TransitSystem
* Each bus is an object that 
Card
* Each card is an object and the cardholder contains each card object as an attribute 




How to run our code


Priority List:
The order of execution:
1. Select a preset/make your own city layout
2. In user, register as a card holder
3. In card options add at least 1 card
4. You can now explore the options described below


To start the program you need to run main from Main.java
*  In the first menu you may choose to use a preset  by entering 1 or create your own city.

A clear discussion of the design decisions in FEATURES.txt
* Presets
   * To make it easier to create a list of bus stops and stations since manually inputting it every time the file runs is extensive work.
* Cardholder Cards 
   * As each card is an object we store them in each cardholder object to allow us to easily access the card from the cardholder
* Trips Object
   * We Implemented a trips object as we realized card holder’s can have multiple trips, this also made it easier for us to compare a bus trip to a subway trip and compare and check whether or not the time and location is valid.
* Subway  
   * Contains a global variable SUBWAY_COST which we use to calculate the cost of a ride on a subway. The reason it is global is so it is more module and easy for the developer to change the subway cost to what they want based on their city
* Buses
   * Contains a global variable BUS_COST which we use to calculate the cost of a ride on a subway. The reason it is global is so it is more module and easy for the developer to change the subway cost to what they want based on their city
* Transit System(Parent Class)
   * To have the option of modularity, as we are able to add more systems into our program in the future as per our clients needs such as a taxi or a ferry.
* Main
   * Added a menu input where the user enters numbers to choose from our list of options, as we tried making this program user interactive and allow to user to be using our program in real time
